# Hats Challenge #2

## Capture the Flag

The contract [`Vault.sol`](./contracts/Vault.sol) is an ERC4626-like vault customized to be used with ETH.
It allows anyone to deposit ETH in the vault and get shares corresponding to the amount deposited.
The shares are an ERC20 which can be freely used by users, functioning effectively just like [Wrapped ETH](https://weth.io).
The shares can also be redeemed at any time for the corresponding underlying amount of ETH.

## The Hats Challenge

The [`Vault.sol`](./contracts/Vault.sol) is deployed with the contract owning 1 ETH of the shares. 

Your mission is to capture the flag by emptying the vault, then calling `captureTheFlag` with an address you control to prove that you have succeeded in completing the challenge, so that `vault.flagHolder` returns your address.

## How to submit

- Solutions must be submitted through the hats application at https://app.hats.finance/vulnerability
- You must submit a working demonstration of the solution. This could be, for example, a hardhat project in which you fork the project and provide a script that will obtain the flag.
- The contract is deployed on goerli: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x8043e6836416d13095567ac645be7C629715885c#code . However, if you do not want to give away the solution to your competitors, do not execute anything on-chain :)

## Run Hack Proof of Concept
